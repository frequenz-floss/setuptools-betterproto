"""Setuptools hook entry-point to finalize the distribution options.

The `finalize_distribution_options` function is called by setuptools to finalize the
distribution options. It adds the `compile_betterproto` command to the build sub-commands
and replaces the `sdist` command with a custom one that includes the proto files.

It will also build the proto files early if the distribution is a binary distribution.
This is necessary to include the generated Python files in the binary distribution,
otherwise the file discovery runs before we manage to compile the proto files.

We still need to hook the sub-command into the build command to make sure editable
installs work correctly.
